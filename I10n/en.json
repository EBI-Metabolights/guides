Alternatively you can use the upload option in the Files tab of your study in the Online editor view of your study.<br><br> There are 2 file upload methods;<br><br>(1) <b><i>Aspera connect plugin</b></i> (recommended)<br>Aspera is a plugin that is very simple to install in your browser. Select the  Aspera Upload option and then Install plugin. Aspera is a fast way of transferring files which also enables the user to stop the transfer, and later resume where you left off. If you see raw data files in the final upload with .aspx appended, the file upload may have paused. Please open Aspera connect on your computer to check the status of your upload and resume upload if necessary. If the upload has completed you can delete the .aspx appended files or contact us to do so. NB. You may need to contact your local IT support if you do not have privileges to install browser plugins.<br><br>(2) <b><i>FTP</b></i><br>FTP can be used on any computer, either directly from the command line or through a graphical user interface. However, on must computers you have to install an FTP client first. If you are not familiar with using FTP from the command line, we can recommend the free FileZilla tool. Please see the FAQ section on the FileZilla pages for specific details about how this software works.<br>",
